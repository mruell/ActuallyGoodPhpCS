# ActuallyGoodPhpCS
A php coding standard, that does not suck.

I code a lot with JS and use eslint with standardJS. As there is no Coding Standard, that is ever so slightly near that, so I created one.

Important was, that the coding standard is supported by a linter that runs with VS Code, as this is my main development IDE.

Have fun with it and give love to the projects, this does depend on â™¥

## How to install

### 3rd party dependencies

- You will need to install this standard for unused variable support: https://github.com/sirbrillig/phpcs-variable-analysis/
- Of course you will need phpcs: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer

### To install

- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Now set the installed_paths of phpcs to find this and the unused variable standard. For this execute following code (In case you want to install globally):

*HINT: Installed paths needs to get a comma seperated list of the paths of all standards, beside the in-built.*

```
phpcs --config-set installed_paths "<GLOBAL_COMPOSER_PATH>\Composer\vendor\sirbrillig\phpcs-variable-analysis,<PATH_OF_THIS_REPO>\ActuallyGoodPhpCS"
```
